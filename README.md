- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Martin
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in different languages and learning as much as I can to become a proficient full-stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through an IBM course and practicing on my own.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job as a developer because, despite having one year of experience as a frontend developer in a company, I am finding it a bit challenging to secure a new opportunity.
